# machine-learning
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks where ML models have been trained using vanilla Python and Numpy.

Implementing those algorithms from scratch is a good exercise to strenghten one's grasp on the underlying math.

## Running the notebooks
To run these notebooks, you need to make sure you have the appropriate dependencies.
You will need the following:
* Python 3
* Numpy: Python library that provides high level functions to operate on matrices easily.
* Matlplotlib: Plotting library. It is not necessary but useful to visualize some of the data. If you do not install it, make sure you comment out the lines that use it.
* Jupyter: The files in this repository are primarily Jupyter notebooks. If you have an Python IDE, you can simply use that.

With the above dependencies you can launch any jupyter notebook. For instance:
```
jupyter notebook digit-classifier/Digit\ classifier.ipynb
```
